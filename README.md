# Excel

This project uses an Excel Pivot Table to analyse total sales (£) segmented by age group, product category, and gender. The dataset was sourced from coursework and prepared in Excel to ensure accurate categorisation and consistent formatting prior to analysis. Interactive slicers allow users to filter by gender, age group, and product category, enabling dynamic exploration of sales patterns and comparisons across customer segments. This analysis demonstrates the use of pivot tables, slicers, and Excel-based exploratory data analysis to identify trends in purchasing behaviour.
