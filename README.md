Overview

This project uses an Excel Pivot Table to analyse total sales (£) segmented by age group, product category, and gender. The objective of the analysis is to explore customer purchasing patterns and compare sales performance across different demographic and product segments.

Dataset

The dataset was sourced from coursework and prepared in Microsoft Excel prior to analysis. Data preparation steps ensured accurate categorisation, consistent formatting, and reliable sales values suitable for pivot table analysis.

Analysis Approach

The analysis was conducted using Excel Pivot Tables to aggregate total sales by age group, product category, and gender. Interactive slicers were added to enable dynamic filtering, allowing users to explore how sales patterns change across different customer segments and product categories.
